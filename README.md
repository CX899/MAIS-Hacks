# MAIS-Hacks

## Inspiration
Having played countless hours of Valorant and League, we know how toxic player chat can be, creating a negative experience for everyone involved. 
In response, we have created HowToBeNice.io.

## What it does
Howtobenice.io is a web app that detects profanities and outputs random positive words. We created a second python program that detects profanities 
depending on a syntactic category through POS tag(Part of Speech Tagging) with spaCy and NLP. This system could be implemented in various games to spread 
positivity instead of toxicity. 

##How we built it
The Howtobenice web app was based on the React JS library using HMTL, CSS and JavaScript. For the python part, this backend aspect was created by
using the spaCy library for NLP in python. By using the POS tag, it categorizes the words of the sentence by their syntactic category and returns all 
the words into separate lists to be later changed into more nice words if the expression is detected to be mean.

##Challenges we ran into
This was our first hackathon, so we ran into many challenges! Collaborating through Git was difficult as we had no experience in having many people work
on the same repository. Another was coding a website using React JS and Node JS, as it was our first big build using these technologies. We were able to 
overcome these problems with the generous help of a mentor at MAIS Hacks 2022.

##Accomplishments that we're proud of
Since it was our first Hackaton and from the fact that we had little to no knowledge of AI, we are proud to be able to present a well-rounded app to the 
judges that include the ideas of AI.

##What we learned
We developed our python skills and got much more familiar with AI libraries and techniques. We also got to learn the React JS library, Node Js library 
and learned how to work as a team with Git. 

##What's next for HowToBeNice.io
We would love to implement the python syntactic category program to the backend of our web app. We also would like to add features such as speech 
recognition, foreign languages toxicity recognition and add multiple options for suggestions for good words.
